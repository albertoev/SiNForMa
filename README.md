Android APP for students to learnt the dificulties to teach a numerical system.

This repository contains the sources of an Android App tool designed so that future teachers (or even those who are already teachers) can experience in their flesh the difficulties that a child must go through while learning the positional numbering system that we usually use. To this end, and given that both future and current teachers already know our numbering system, our application forces them to face a new numbering system completely new to them, guiding them through the different stages they will have to overcome to master it.

This application is being used intensively in teaching students of the Facultad de Ciencias de la Educación - Centro de Formación de Profesorado of the Universidad Complutense de Madrid.
